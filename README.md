There are two sections to this work 
  - cleaning and standardising survey effort
  - cleaning and standardising biodiversity data

Code is adapted from work by Meadhbh Moriarty in 2016 and built on by Ruth Kelly 2021.

In general the goals of the scripts in series are outline below:
Goal 1. Check survey data for outliers and query with data providers. This code has been re-run to insure all errors that have been 
            reported have been removed from DATRAS, otherwise a "fix" is used
            
Goal 2. Derive Surveys and fix errors not updated in DATRAS
Goal 3. Estimate missing/incorrect gear parameters
Goal 4. Calculate Swept Area and Swepth Volume
Goal 5. Estimate missing/incorrect biological parameters
Goal 6. Calculate Swept Area densities
